# Unexpected Results from Subtraction Function
This TypeScript code demonstrates a potential bug where the subtraction function may produce unexpected or incorrect results. The issue arises from the lack of specific error handling or constraints for negative results.  The `subtract` function doesn't explicitly check for or handle cases where the result might be negative, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in certain scenarios.  The provided solution addresses this by adding checks and handling for scenarios involving negative results.
